I thank Deborah Kamen, James Clauss, and Olga Levaniouk for their support in the design and development of the online offering of CLAS 205. This site and additional course materials were created by Suh Young Choi, with inspiration from previous CLAS 205 offerings by Diana Molkova, Cat Chase, and Laura Harris. Special thanks to A. M. Davis, Liam Dulany, and Caden Hanrahan for their feedback on the initial version of this site.

This website is generated by Just the Docs.

Though I cannot list them all, I am also deeply grateful for the countless students who have given their feedback and helped improve CLAS 205 over the quarters. You all are the reason why this book exists.
