### Objectives

1. Provide more context for how organisms are named
2. Become familiar with common bases in naming

## Order-Rank Naming

In the previous lesson, we saw how each living organism is classified according to the **order-rank system**. Aside from the genera that are named after people, most of the ranks will be able to tell you something specific about the organisms in that group. In most cases, any Latin or Greek forms will be left as close to the original languages as possible. The ranks are meant to be descriptive and somewhat intuitive for the biologist decently-versed in Latin and Greek roots. The following are some tables for roots commonly found in many scientific names. (Some of these have appeared in other lessons already!)

### Colors

Color words from both languages are used in scientific naming, hence the two tables. Most of the same colors are represented, but there are some which are unique to their own language.

#### Latin

| Root          | Latin form                | Meaning       |
| :---:         | :---                      | :---          |
| alb           | albus/alba                | white         |
| rub/ruf       | ruber/rubra/rufus/rufa    | red           |
| nigr          | niger/nigra               | black         |
| cyan(o)       | cyanus/cyana              | blue          |
| flav(o)       | flavus/flava              | yellow        |
| candid(o)     | candidus/candida          | bright, white |
| virid         | viridis                   | green         |
| pall(i)       | pallidus/pallida          | pale          |
| purpur(eo)    | purpureus/purpurea        | purple        |

| chlor(o)      | chloros/chlore            | green         |

### Body Parts

Most of these words refer to parts of the body which are not internal organs.

| Definition            | Latin form        | Greek form        |
| :---                  | :---              | :---              |

### Shapes

Some scientific names describe a particular feature of the organism using a familiar shape. These roots are typically found in compounds with other roots and do not often stand on their own.

| Root      | Language of origin        | Meaning           |
| :---:     | :---:                     | :---              |
| actin     | Greek                     | ray (like the sun)              |
| onco      | Greek                     | mass, bulk        |

### Common Animals

Because Latin was so widely used in science at the time that taxonomies were being developed, animals which were commonly seen across Europe have their names taken from the literal word for that animal in Latin. Here are some examples.

| Animal        | Latin name        |
| :---          | :---              |
| dog           | canis             |
| cat           | feles             |
| bird          | avis              |
| fish          | piscis            |
| horse         | equus             |
| bee           | apis              |
| wolf          | lupus             |
| fox           | vulpes            |
| bear          | ursus             |
| lion          | leo               |
| snake         | serpens           |
| eagle         | aquila            |
| monkey, ape   | simia             |

{: .note}
> Animals which take their genus or species name after a human or geographical name will usually have names that end in *-a*, *-us*, *-is*, *-ense*, or *-um*.

## Decolonizing Names

In November of 2023, the American Ornithological Society announced that it would change the English names of every bird that was named after a person, or whose name was deemed offensive or outdated. Examples include Lewis' woodpecker and Steller's sea jay. This decision reflects a broader trend in the scientific community to reassess the legacy of colonialism and the implications of naming practices that have historically marginalized certain groups. By renaming birds like Lewis' woodpecker and Steller's sea jay, the AOS aims to create a more equitable framework that respects the diverse cultures and histories associated with these names.

The practice of naming species after individuals often stems from colonial-era traditions, where explorers and scientists would commemorate their discoveries by attaching their own names or those of their contemporaries to new species. However, many of these names have become problematic over time, as they can glorify figures whose actions contributed to oppression or whose legacies are contentious. The renaming initiative seeks to remove these associations, allowing for a more nuanced understanding of biodiversity that does not rely on outdated or harmful narratives. By adopting names that celebrate indigenous cultures, reflect local knowledge, or are simply more accurate for the species they describe, the AOS is fostering a sense of belonging and respect for the communities that have historically been sidelined in scientific discourse.

The same shift has been harder to see in scientific names that follow the Linnaen system, since most names are given to represent specific characteristics of a particular organism. However, as we saw in the last lesson, there are still many organisms that bear people's names. Loeflingia, named for one of Linnaeus's students, is a genus of bristly plants in the carnation family (*Caryophyllaceae*). Unless the naming of the plant had something to do with Pehr Löfling's personality, it's difficult to see how the name is supposed to describe the organism.

In reality, scientific names rarely change, and when they do, it tends to be for physiological and biological reasons, such as reclassifying an organism into a different genus. For example, the Giant Panda was originally classified in the *Ailuridae* family (raccoons), but was later found to be genetically different enough from raccoons to constitute their own family, the *Ailuropodidae*.

However, the movement to decolonize common names is gaining traction and prompting discussions about whether a similar reassessment of scientific names is warranted. As awareness of the implications of colonial legacies grows, there is increasing pressure on the scientific community to consider the historical context of naming practices. While changing scientific names poses challenges—such as the need for consensus within the taxonomic community and the potential for confusion among researchers—it also presents an opportunity to align scientific nomenclature with contemporary values of inclusivity and respect for local and indigenous cultures.

Furthermore, engaging with this discourse might encourage a more holistic approach to naming that recognizes the importance of indigenous knowledge and cultural significance in the context of biodiversity. By fostering dialogue around these issues, scientists can work toward a more equitable framework that not only respects the organisms themselves but also the communities that have long been connected to them. Ultimately, the movement to decolonize names—both common and scientific—has the potential to reshape how we understand and interact with the natural world, reinforcing the idea that science is not only about classification but also about the stories we choose to tell and the values we uphold.

## Vocabulary Practice

**Practice Set A.** Based on the table of Latin animals, tell what animal each term relates to.

1. apiary
2. canine
3. equestrian
4. aquiline
5. Pisces
6. feline
7. aviator
8. serpentine
9. simian
10. Ursa Major

**Practice Set B.** Identify the roots in each of the following words, give their language of origin, and their definitions. Then, following the guidelines in Lesson 4, arrange the definitions of the individual roots to create a literal definition.

1. piscivorous
2. capillary
3. dorsal
4. inoculate
5. Rhamphorhynchus (an extinct flying reptile)
6. cephalopod
7. platypus
8. macrodontia
9. ventral
10. rhinoceros (Hint: you may find one of these roots in Project 1)

## Reflection Questions

1. Which of these roots were familiar to you? Which were not? In what contexts have you seen them?
2. Look ahead to Project 1. Where do you see some of these terms appearing? (Name at least 3 instances)
3. In your opinion, should the same effort to remove human names from common names be applied to scientific names? Why or why not?
