## Objectives

1. Learn how Greek and Latin are used in anatomy
2. Translate and interpret Latin in its original form in anatomical contexts

## Greek and Latin in Anatomy

It would be all too easy to say that Greek and Latin form the backbone (ha!) of anatomical terminology. While both languages have their usages in medical vocabulary, Latin tends to appear in its original form more often than Greek in anatomical terms. This is because Latin was the language of instruction in medical schools and universities across Europe for centuries, especially during the Renaissance and following the Scientific Revolution. As a result, many of the anatomical terms were directly borrowed from Latin and have retained their original forms (e.g., *cranium*, *femur*). Greek tends to appear more frequently in the names of processes, structures, or conditions (e.g., *arthritis*, *gastrointestinal*).

This system of naming using Greek and Latin roots is not limited to humans; it extends to the study of animals as well. The same conventions apply when describing animal anatomy, as the use of Latin and Greek allows for a consistent framework that can be used to describe similarities and differences across species. (Most vertebrates, for example, have *vertebrae*, or a backbone.) However, for simplicity and practicality, anatomical terminology in this lesson will focus primarily on the human body.

## Additional Latin Terminology

Latin anatomical terms are usually composed of only adjectives and nouns, as we've seen in previous lessons. Adjectives, however, come with an additional twist: there are three degrees, called **positive**, **comparative**, and **superlative**. The **positive** degree is when the adjective stands on its own without implying any kind of comparison. The **comparative** degree indicates a comparison between two objects, and the **superlative** indicates a comparison between three or more objects.

Let's look at some examples in English:

| Positive          | Comparative           | Superlative           |
| :---              | :---                  | :---                  |
| happy             | happier               | happiest              |
| green             | greener               | greenest              |
| sharp             | sharper               | sharpest              |
| beautiful         | more beautiful        | most beautiful        |
| complex           | more complex          | most complex          |

From the examples above, we can see that in English, the comparative form is made by attaching *-er* to the end of an adjective, or using the word *more* in front. The superlative form is made by attaching *-est* to the end of an adjective, or using the word *most* in front.

Latin, similarly, has some formulas that we can use to express the comparative and superlative degrees. The ending *-ior/-ius* is fixed to the end of comparative adjectives, and the ending *-issimus/-issima/-issimum* is fixed to the end of superlative adjectives. 

{: .note}
> Comparative adjectives in Latin are always third-declension, and superlatives are first/second-declension. Using *brevis* as an example, you would say *brevis, brevior, brevissimus* for a masculine subject, *brevis, brevior, brevissima* for a feminine subject, and *brevis, brevius, brevissimum* for a neuter subject.

The following comparative adjectives appear frequently in anatomy:

| Latin                 | English               |
| :---                  | :---                  |
| superior              | upper                 |
| inferior              | lower                 |
| anterior              | in front, forward     |
| posterior             | in back, behind       |
| interior              | inside, within        |
| exterior              | outside               |

The two exceptions to the comparative and superlative formulas that we'll see in this class are *maximus* and *minimus*, meaning "largest" and "smallest", respectively. To say "larger" and "smaller", we would say *major* and *minor*, respectively. (One way to remember these is that your *major* is your larger concentration, while your *minor* is your smaller concentration!)

### Common Formulas

As mentioned in Lesson 18, while there are (at least) ten forms of each Latin noun, you won't see many of them in practice. Latin anatomical names follow some fairly regular patterns, most of which involve only nominatives and genitives, often in the singular. Here are some common formulas:

| Formula               | How to Translate                      |
| :---                  | :---                                  |
| nom (a.)              | <nom (a.)>                            |
| nom (n.)              | <nom (n.)>                            |
| nom (n.) - gen (n.)   | <nom (n.)> of the <gen 9n.>           |
| nom (n.) - nom (a.)   | <nom (a.)> <nom (n.)>                 |
| nom (n.) - gen (n.) - gen (a.) | <nom (n.)> of the <gen (a.)> <gen (n.)> |
| nom (n.) - nom (a.) - gen (a.) | <nom (a.)> <nom (n.)> of the <gen (n.)> |
| nom (n.) - nom (a.) - nom (a.) | <nom (a.)> <nom (a.)> <nom (n.)>        |

In three-word phrases, the order of words in the same case doesn't matter. It's possible to have a `nom (n.) - gen (a.) - gen (n.)` phrase that would still have the same formula as the third row.

The pattern continues the same way for longer phrases, no matter how many adjectives are added. Here are some additional rules of thumb for Latin anatomical phrases:

- There is always at least one nominative, whether adjective or noun.
- Sometimes there is a genitive noun.
- In order to have an adjective, a phrase must have a noun.
- Mutliple adjectives an apply to the same noun.

## Body Parts

### Bones

The Latin word for bone is *os* (genitive *ossis*, plural *ossa*), so the Latin names for many bones formally begins with *os*. For example, the *os temporale* is the *temporal bone*, or the bone at your temple. However, in practice, several bones are referred to by their second names, such as the *humerus* or the *femur*. Here are some you may know:

| Bone              | English translation               |
| :---              | :---                              |
| humerus           | upper arm (bone)                  |
| radius            | ray (i.e., inner forearm)         |
| ulna              | elbow (i.e., outer forearm)       |
| scapula           | shoulder (i.e., shoulder blades)  |
| vertebrae         | spine (bone)                      |
| femur             | thigh (bone)                      |
| coccyx            | tailbone                          |
| sternum           | chest (bone)                      |
| patella           | kneecap                           |
| tibia             | shin (bone)                       |
| fibula            | calf (bone)                       |
| talus             | ankle (bone)                      |

Latin names for bones are usually two words. Typically, they will follow a nominative-genitive pattern with two nouns, or a nominative-nominative pattern with a noun and an adjective. The first nominative is usually *os*. Here are some examples, with translations:

| Bone              | English translation               | Formula                   |
| :---              | :---                              | :---                      |
| os temporale      | temporal bone                     | nom (n.) - nom (a.)       |
| os frontale       | frontal bone (front of skull)     | nom (n.) - nom (a.)       |
| os nasale         | nose bone                         | nom (n.) - nom (a.)       |
| os parietalis     | parietal bone (side of skull)     | nom (n.) - nom (a.)       |
| os occipitalis    | occipital bone (back of skull)    | nom (n.) - nom (a.)       |
| os costae         | rib bone (lit., bone of the rib)  | nom (n.) - gen (n.)       |

### Muscles

The Latin word for muscle is *musculus* (genitive *musculi*). Similar to bones, the Latin names for most muscles formally begin with the word *musculus*. However, this also drops out in practice. For example, the *musculus biceps* is better known just as the *biceps* (a muscle in your upper arm).

Unlike bones, though, most muscle names do not keep the word *musculus*. As such, you might imagine that the word *musculus* is secretly at the beginning of any muscle name that you see. 

Some muscle names also describe their function and how they move in the body. For example, a *compressor* is a muscle that *presses together* or contracts, while an *extensor* is a muscle that *stretches out* or extends. (Usually, you can figure out the meanings of these Latin compounds because of their resemblance to words in English. Barring that, you can always check individual roots!)

Latin muscle names often follow a two-word pattern. In nominative-genitive patterns, the first word usually describes the type of muscle (or other distinguishing feature), and the second word usually describes where you would find the muscle. In nominative-nominative patterns, the order is usually reversed. The first word describes where to locate the muscle, while the second word describes a physical characteristic. Note the examples below:

| Muscle name           | English translation           | Pattern                   |
| :---                  | :---                          | :---                      |
| pectoralis major      | larger pectoral (muscle)      | nom (a.) - nom (a.)       |
| gluteus maximus       | largest glute (muscle)        | nom (a.) - nom (a.)       |
| fibularis longus      | long fibula (muscle)          | nom (a.) - nom (a.)       |
| tibialis anterior     | forward tibia (muscle)        | nom (a.) - nom (a.)       |
| rectus abdominis      | straight (muscle) of the abdomen | nom (a.) - gen (n.)    |
| biceps brachii        | two-headed (muscle) of the arm | nom (a.) - gen (n.)      |
| quadriceps femoris    | four-headed (muscle) of the thigh | nom (a.) - gen (n.)   |

### Organs

Every organ in the human body has a Latin name, but these are rarely used because we already have English words that are easier to use and understand. The Latin names for organs are usually used in Latin phrases, either as a genitive or with an adjective. Here are some commonly used Latin terms for various body parts, along with their genitives. The gender of each noun is marked with (m.) for masculine, (f.) for feminine, and (n.) for neuter.

| Nominative        | Genitive          | English           |
| :---              | :---              | :---              |
| cor               | cordis            | heart             |
| pulmo             | pulmonis          | lung              |
| ren               | renis             | kidney            |
| venter            | ventris           | stomach           |
| oculus            | oculi             | eye               |
| nas               | naris             | nose              |
| cerebrum          | cerebri           | brain             |
| sanguis           | sanguinis         | blood             |
| hepar             | hepatis           | liver             |
| iecur             | iecuris           | liver             |

{: .note}
> Latin uses two words for liver. *hepar* is borrowed from Greek, while *iecur* is originally Latin.

## Reflection Questions

1. What Latin or Greek terms have you seen in anatomy before?
2. The introduction to this lesson mentions that Greek is more common in the names of diseases and processes, while Latin is more common for body parts. Why do you think this is? Consider the differences in the ways that Greek and Roman medicine were practiced.
3. In what ways are the naming of body parts and the naming of organisms, elements, and astronomical objects similar? How are they different?
4. For each of the Latin terms for organs, can you determine what declension they are in? How can you tell?
