# Project 4: Medical School ðŸ©º
{: .no_toc}

## Objectives
{: .no_toc}
1. Synthesize knowledge of Greek and Latin roots from the quarter to determine the meanings behind medical terminology
2. Recognize and translate Latin phrases as they are used in anatomy
3. Interpret unfamiliar medical jargon for general audiences

## Relevance
{: .no_toc}

In this project, you will put your word breakdown and interpretation skills against the human body and its various maladies. You will be asked to consider the meanings of the names of body parts, diseases, and drugs, and how each of these names relate to their function and purpose. When thinking about the meanings of words, it's also important to communicate these interpretations for audiences outside the field.

1. TOC
{:toc}

## ðŸ“š Problem 1: The Latin Corpus

Translate each of the following terms from Latin to English, and tell what part of the body is being referred to.

1. oculus sinister
2. latissimus dorsi
3. superior vena cava
4. articulatio genus
5. os coxae

## ðŸ”Ž Problem 2: Diagnostic Imagining

Give the meanings of each of the roots (including endings) in the following disease names. Then, look up and give some of the disease's symptoms. Given these symptoms, is the name of the disease appropriate or potentially misleading?

1. rubella
2. tuberculosis
3. hemorrhoids
4. xerosis
5. gonycampsis

## ðŸ”Ž Problem 3: It's Just Hormones

Give the meanings of each of the roots in the following hormones. Then, look up and give the hormone's purpose. How does its name relate to its function in the body?

1. erythropoietin
2. cholecystokinin
3. somatostatin
4. osteocalcin
5. vasopressin

## ðŸ”Ž Problem 4: The Deal with Drugs

Give the meanings of each of the roots in the following drug classes. Look up and give the use(s) of each, and give a specific disease or condition that it is used for. Based on the meaning of its name, how do you think each type of drug works in the body?

1. antineoplastics
2. corticosteroids
3. topical antiseptics
4. sympathomimetics
5. analgesics

## ðŸ“š Problem 5: What's Up, Doc?

Congratulations! After reviewing your hard work in CLAS 205, the Americal Medical Association was really impressed by your knowledge of Greek and Latin roots. They've discovered four new diseases with long, complicated names that no one outside the AMA understands (except you, of course). The AMA needs your help to inform the public about these new diseases!

For each of the disease names, write a short informative paragraph of 50-100 words that describes each disease's symptoms, based on their names. You can optionally invent details relating to the disease's transmission, mortality rate, or people who are at most risk for contracting it. Remember&mdash; you're writing for the general public, who is not familiar with Latin, Greek, or medical jargon.

1. hyperspasmosomnia
2. endothermophlebitis
3. lepidonychodactyly
4. purpureocytoplastoids

Once you've written the paragraph for each of these diseases, write a reflection of about 100-200 words explaining how you interpreted each of these disease names. What details did you draw from the disease names, and which did you add on your own?

{: .note}
> These are all fictional diseases, but the description of symptoms should relate back to their names.

## ðŸ”Ž Challenge Problem: Under Oath

Create your own medical oath! Your oath should include guidelines and tenets for how a doctor should behave professionally, how they would treat their patients, and how they will practice medicine. The oath does not have to be exhaustive, but you should include at least 5 tenets. You can use any of the following historical and modern oaths as inspiration.

- [The Hippocratic Oath](https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3atext%3a1999.01.0252)
- [The Oath of Asaph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sefer_Refuot#Oath_of_Asaph_text)
- [Vejjavatapada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vejjavatapada#English_Translation)
- [The Seventeen Rules of Enjuin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seventeen_Rules_of_Enjuin)
- [PennState College of Medicine's Oath of Modern Hippocrates](https://students.med.psu.edu/md-students/oath/)
- [World Medical Association Declaration of Geneva](https://www.wma.net/policies-post/wma-declaration-of-geneva/)

Then, in a reflection of about 100 words, explain your process behind creating your oath and why you included each of your tenets.

<!-- - What do these oaths have in common? Do these align with "universal" ethical values in medical practice?
- How do these oaths differ? Consider the historical, cultural, and religious contexts surrounding each oath. What might these differences tell you about the identity of a doctor in each culture?
- Do the tenets of each oath align with how you think doctors should act professionally? Why or why not? -->
